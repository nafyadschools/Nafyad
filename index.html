      <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
    Nafyad School, a prominent private institution in Adama town, was founded in 1993 E.C. in Kebele 10, covering a spacious area of 25,866 mÂ². Initially focused on providing quality education for Kindergarten (KG) and Grades 1-4, the school quickly gained recognition for its high commitment to academic excellence.
